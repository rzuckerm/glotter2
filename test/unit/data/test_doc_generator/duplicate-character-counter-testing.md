Every project in the [Some Repo repo](https://github.com/some-user/some-repo) should be tested.
In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Duplicate Character Counter.
In order to keep things simple, we split up the testing as follows:

- Duplicate Character Counter Valid Tests
- Duplicate Character Counter Invalid Tests

### Duplicate Character Counter Valid Tests

| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| Sample Input: No Duplicates | "hola" | "No duplicate characters" |

### Duplicate Character Counter Invalid Tests

| Description | Input |
| ----------- | ----- |

All of these tests should output the following:
