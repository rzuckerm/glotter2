# Glotter2

This is a fork of the original [Glotter](https://github.com/auroq/glotter) repository, which
appears to be unmaintained.

Glotter is an execution library for collections of single file scripts. It uses Docker to be able to build, run, and optionally test scripts in any language without having to install a local sdk or development environment.
